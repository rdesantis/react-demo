# Little Lemon Booking: React demo app

This app implements a table booking system for the fictional Little Lemon restaurant.  It demonstrates the usage of many modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React features.

The code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  To run the app or the unit tests, you must have a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Run the app as explained below.  On the home page, click the **Reserve a table** button to begin the table booking workflow.

The app uses responsive design.  Use your browser's developer tools to view the pages as they would appear in various screen sizes, down to mobile phone sizes.

All form inputs are validated.  Try entering invalid data or leaving fields blank to see how the validations work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make any code changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
